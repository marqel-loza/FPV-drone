# FPV-drone
 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
I designed and built a fully functional FPV (First Person View) quadcopter from scratch as a hands-on introduction to mechatronics and robotics systems. Gaining knowledge and experience in mechatronics, embedded systems, electronics.
Project Objectives

Understand mechatronic system integration by combining mechanical design, electronic hardware, sensors, and software.

Design and assemble a complete FPV drone using separate components such as the frame, motors, ESCs, flight controller, FPV camera, VTX, receiver, and power system.

Develop practical skills in soldering, wiring, calibration, PID tuning, and troubleshooting.

Learn embedded control concepts, including motor control, sensor fusion (IMU/gyro), and stability algorithms.
